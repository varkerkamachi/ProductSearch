ProductSearch is a simple Rails application that allows users to search Semantics3's product database.

Fork the repository at: https://github.com/fingerprint/ProductSearch

## Prerequisites

- You will need to create an account at Semantics3 (https://semantics3.com/start).

- Once your account has been activated (email verification is required), add the API_KEY and API_SECRET to the .env file (see .env.sample in the root of project).

## Objective

- Implement caching, where Semantics3 query responses are stored in a *SQL* database to speed-up subsequent searches (note: cache invalidation is not a requirement).

- Implement unit testing.

## Optionals

1. Use a JavaScript front-end framework (React, Vue.js, Angular, etc.)

2. Implement a simple interface that allows an “admin” to review, add, or remove items from the cache.

3. Implement pagination.
